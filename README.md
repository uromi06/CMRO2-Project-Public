# CMRO₂ from Synthetic CBV — research notebook

> Estimate cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO₂) from qMRI inputs (CBV, CBF, T2, T2*) using a 3D U-Net ensemble inside a conditional GAN framework.  
> **Code only** — no data or trained weights are distributed.

## Project pipeline

![Overview of pipeline](project_pipeline.png)

**Goal:** Predict CMRO₂ from routinely available MRI (CBV, CBF, T2, T2*).  
**Preprocess:** Apply group GM mask, resample to `48×64×48`.  
**Model:** Generator = ensemble of four 3D U-Nets with residual and attention blocks; Discriminator = 3D CNN with spectral normalization.  
**Output:** Single-channel CMRO₂ volume.

## Case-study phases (modality ablations)

We evaluate the trained generator under four input configurations:

- **All modalities** (baseline)
- **–CBV**
- **–CBF**
- **–CBV & –CBF**

**Aggregate performance (MSE / Pearson):**

## How to use

1. **Environment**
   ```bash
   # create a venv (example)
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate            # Windows
   # source .venv/bin/activate         # macOS/Linux
   pip install -r requirements.txt


2. **Notebooks**

- **model_training.ipynb** – training + metrics + visualizations
- **case_study.ipynb** – modality ablations (–CBV/–CBF/–CBV&CBF)

3. **Configure paths**

In the first config cell, set:
base_path, gm_mask_base_path, gm_mask_filename
patient_ids (train/test)

No dataset or weights are included. Train on your own data with appropriate permissions.

## Data
